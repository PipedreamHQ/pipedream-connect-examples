## Managed Auth

The **[managed-auth-basic-next-app](/managed-auth-basic-next-app/)** shows the foundational managed auth capability, which enables your end users to connect their account for any of the 2,900 apps available on Pipedream. This is an example Next.js app, but Pipedream has [SDKs available in TypeScript, Python, and Java](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/api-reference/sdks) to go along with the REST API. [Refer to our docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect) for more info.

## Connect React

The **[connect-react-demo](/connect-react-demo/)** demonstrates how you can embed any of the 10,000+ Pipedream actions and triggers directly in your app or AI agent. Check out the [connect-react](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/connect-react) for more info on the SDK, and the [core Pipedream docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/components) for a good overview with detailed examples.

**You can play around with the hosted version of this app at [pipedream.com/connect/demo](https://pipedream.com/connect/demo).**

## MCP

The **[mcp](/mcp/)** directory contains CLI examples that demonstrate how to integrate with Pipedream's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using different AI SDKs for developers who are building AI chat apps or AI agents. See [the docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) for more info.
