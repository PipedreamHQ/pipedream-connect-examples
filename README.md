Learn more about Pipedream Connect [here](https://pipedream.com/connect) and in our official docs [here](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect).

This repo provides a collection of demo apps to highlight example implementations:

- **[managed-auth-basic-next-app](/managed-auth-basic-next-app/)** shows the foundational managed auth capability, which enables your end users to connect their account for any of the 2,700 apps available on Pipedream. This is an example Next.js app, but the SDK works in any JavaScript environment, and there are corresponding REST API as well. [Refer to our docs](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect) for more info.
- **[connect-react-demo](/connect-react-demo/)** demonstrates how you can embed any of the 10k+ Pipedream actions and triggers directly in your app or AI agent. Check out the [connect-react](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/tree/master/packages/connect-react) for more info on the SDK.
